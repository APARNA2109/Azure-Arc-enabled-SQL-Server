# Exercise 3: Azure ARC Extended SQL server in GCP and AWS (Read-Only)

## Overview

Azure Arc extends the Azure cloud beyond Microsoft's data centers. You still interact with Azure tools (the portal, CLI, PowerShell, APIs, SDKs, and even third-party deployment tools such as Terraform), but rather than using them to interact with your Azure resources, you also leverage the same tools to interact with your on-premises infrastructure and other cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
