# Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server Workshop

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 hours

## Overview

Contoso, a global retail company, operates SQL Server databases across various on-premises data centers and remote locations. To streamline management and enhance visibility, Contoso participates in the Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server workshop. The workshop guides Contoso through the process of connecting their SQL Server instances to Azure Arc, enabling unified management through the Azure portal.

The Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server workshop demonstrates how to extend Azure management capabilities to SQL Server instances running on-premises or in other cloud environments. By leveraging Azure Arc, you can centrally manage and govern SQL Server deployments with Azureâ€™s tools and services, regardless of their location.

## Objective

In the hands-on labs, you'll first onboard your on-premises SQL Server instances to Azure Arc, enabling centralized management through the Azure portal. The initial exercise covers connecting a general SQL Server, while the second focuses specifically on integrating SQL Server 2012, ensuring compatibility with older versions. Finally, you'll create a unified management dashboard, or "single pane of glass," that aggregates monitoring and management capabilities across all your SQL Server instances, providing a streamlined view and control of your entire SQL Server environment.

1. **Onboard the On-prem SQLServer to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server:** Connects on-premises SQL Server instances to Azure Arc for centralized management. Participants will successfully connect their on-premises SQL Server instances to Azure Arc, enabling centralized management and visibility from the Azure portal.

1. **Onboard the On-prem SQLServer 2012 to Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server:** Integrates SQL Server 2012 with Azure Arc, ensuring compatibility with older SQL Server versions. Participants will integrate SQL Server 2012 with Azure Arc, allowing them to manage and monitor older SQL Server instances through Azureâ€™s management tools.

1. **Create a Single pane of glass-managed solutions with Azure Arc:** Configures a unified management dashboard in Azure to oversee all SQL Server instances from a single interface. Participants will configure a unified management dashboard in Azure, providing a comprehensive view and control over all their SQL Server instances from a single, centralized interface.

### Explore

Explore and understand the read-only exercises to gain additional knowledge on how Azure ARC SQL Servers can be integrated with other cloud platforms using certain queries:

1. **Azure ARC Extended SQL server for GCP and AWS (Read-Only):** Interact with Azure tools (the portal, CLI, PowerShell, APIs, SDKs, and even third-party deployment tools such as Terraform), including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) via a Kusto query (code) that retrieves information about SQL Servers registered with ARC Extended SQL, including those in GCP and AWS.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Server:** Familiarity with SQL Server concepts and management tasks.
Understanding of Azure Services: Awareness of Azure services and how Azure Arc integrates with on-premises resources.
- **Azure Subscription:** Access to an active Azure subscription with sufficient permissions to register resources and configure Azure Arc.
- **Administrative Access:** Administrative access to on-premises SQL Server instances and the ability to install software and make configuration changes.
- **Networking Basics:** Understanding of networking principles to ensure connectivity between on-premises servers and Azure.

## Architecture



## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves several key components:

- **Azure Arc:** Extends Azure's management and governance capabilities to on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments, enabling unified management, consistent policy enforcement, and centralized monitoring across diverse infrastructure.
- **Virtual Machine:** A virtual machine running on Hyper-V that hosts workloads or applications on-premises.
- **Azure Resource Manager:** For registering and managing resources within the Azure portal.
- **Azure Monitor:** Provides performance metrics, logs, and dashboards for unified monitoring and management of SQL Server instances onboarded to Azure Arc.

## Getting Started with the Lab

1. You can see a virtual machine desktop ðŸ’» (**LABVM**) is loaded on the left side in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can also connect to the virtual machine using any RDP client using the **LABVM** credentials provided in the **Environment Details** tab.

   >Note: If you see any PowerShell windows running in your VM, please do not close that as it's setting up some configurations inside the environment.
 
1. To get the lab environment details, you can select the **Environment Details** tab. Additionally, the credentials will also be emailed to your registered email address. You can also open the Lab Guide in a separate and full window by selecting the **Split Window** from the lower right corner. Also, you can start, stop and restart virtual machines from the **Resources** tab.

   > You will see the SUFFIX value on the **Environment Details** tab, use it wherever you see SUFFIX or DeploymentID in lab steps.
 
## Login to Azure Portal

1. In the JumpVM, click on the Azure portal shortcut of the Microsoft Edge browser which is created on the desktop.

1. On the **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** tab you will see the login screen, in that enter the following email/username, and click on **Next**. 

   * **Email/Username**: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   
      ![](media/getstartpage04.png "Enter Email")
     
1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.
   
   * **Password**: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
   
      ![](media/getstartpage05.png "Enter Password")
     
1. If you see the pop-up **Stay Signed in?**, select **No**.

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** popup window appears, select **Maybe Later** to skip the tour.
   
1. Now you will see the Azure Portal Dashboard, click on **Resource groups** from the Navigate panel to see the resource groups.

By completing these exercises, participants will gain the skills to connect and manage both standard and legacy on-premises SQL Server instances using Azure Arc, allowing for centralized oversight through Azure. They will learn to onboard SQL Server instances, including SQL Server 2012, and create a unified management dashboard using Azure Monitor, providing a comprehensive view and control over their entire SQL Server environment from a single interface.
